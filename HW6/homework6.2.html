<h1>Homework 6 Part 2: Census Data Ratio Choropleth Maps</h1>
<h2>Nea Strawn</h2>
<h3>The maps illustrate employed individuals ages 75 and up vs the working age population (those 16 and up) in New Mexico in the past 12 months. The data was acquired from data.census.gov. It is based on the American Community Survey. I chose this ratio to see how much of the state's employed people are above the typical retirement age.  </h3>
